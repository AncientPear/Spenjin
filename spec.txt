              Object/prototype

      returns:
              Function to be used for creating objects of that class, do not call with "new" operator
                      properties:
                                    recent: a function that returns the most recently created object of that class
                                    instanceArray: an array of instances that the class has created
                      returns:
                                 a Sealed Object using the constructor/prototype from before but:
                                       prototype has constructor reference attached
                                       prototype has prototype with destroy method
                                       prototype also gets reference to its prototype via "super"
      more info:
                when objects are destroy they're pushed to an array where they're later taken out for reuse (constructor is recalled over them)
